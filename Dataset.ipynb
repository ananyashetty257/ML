    "Why Random Forest Regression?\n",
    " Handles Non-Linearity: Unlike Linear Regression, which assumes a straight-line relationship, Random Forest can capture complex patterns in data (e.g., discounts affecting different categories differently).\n",
    "\n",
    " Works Well with Categorical Data: Your dataset has Category and Payment_Method, which aren't purely numerical. Random Forest can handle mixed data types efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    " Prevents Overfitting: Neural Networks tend to overfit on small datasets, but Random Forest uses multiple decision trees to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    " Better Accuracy & Interpretability: While Neural Networks are powerful, they require a lot of tuning and data. Random Forest performs well with minimal tuning and provides feature importance insights.\n",
    "\n",
    " Conclusion: Random Forest Regression is the best choice because it balances accuracy, interpretability, and flexibility while handling non-linear relationships in your dataset. Would you like me to implement it and show the results?"
